<h2>About SPOKC</h2>
<p>SPOKC stands for Serial-Parallel Optimization Kit in C. This project was started to provide a standard for implementing the optimization algorithms. As the project will grow, we will add more of the well known optimization algorithms to it. Researchers who develops new optimization algorithms, can compare the performance of their algorithms with the existing SPOKC standard algorithms without having to re-implement them, and when they are done they can contribute their algorithms to the SPOKC project. This project is published under MIT license and anyone has the full right to do anything with it.</p>
<h2>About RIN</h2>
<p>RIN is the abbreviated form of Research INterface, which is a nonprofit organization for making an interface between graduate and undergraduate folks in Bangladesh with the graduate students studying abroad to provide a flavor of world class research.</p>

<h2>Why should you (an undergrad) contribute to this project?</h2>
<ul>
<li>As an undergrad you are not expected to do significant contributions to any research areas. Rather your goal is to explore your research interest, build a foundation for future research, and get exposure to graduate level research. This project is perfect for you. It is neither too complex, nor too simple. However, if you are ahead of your peers, you will have the opportunity to do real contributions in this area, i.e., develop a new optimization algorithm, and possibly publish a paper.</li>
<li>You will expand your knowledge on Mathametical Optimization. The demands of experts on Mathametical optimization is growing rapidly. From sports scheduling to arranging products in a grocery shop, from designing layouts of microprocessors to making a better compiler, and every activity in your everyday life can be optimized.</li>
<li>You will become the best programmer. Because of my (the project supervisor) obsession of writing the most optimized code in the "right" way, I will push you to become your best.</li>
<li>You will be writing parallel algorithms. The world is shifting towards parallel computing, and in a few years knowing how to write parallel code will become an essential skill for any job.</li>
<li>You will be contributing to a world class open-source project. Almost all the companies in North America now ask for open-source contributions in the interview. And if you can prove yourself to be a very good contributor, I will help you to contribute to bigger open-source projects like hacking the linux kernel.</li>
<li>I can give you a "kick ass" reccommandation, if you want to persue your masters/phd at UBC's <a href='http://ocana.ok.ubc.ca/index.php'>OCANA</a> group, which is the 2nd biggest optimiation research group in Canada. Both Dr. Yves Lucet and Dr. Warren Hare value my reccommandations.</li>
<li>You will grow your skills on: Linux, Git, Pointers, Memory management, Algorithms, Algorithm convergence, Numerical instabilities, Unit testing, Parallel computing, Logic, Math, Proof, Set theory, Linear Algebra, etc.</li>
<li>A small funding may be available.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<p>SPOKC supports a wide range of optimization algorithms. The SPOKC standard algorithms minimize the following function: $$f:R^{n}→R$$ given a set of constraints. What it means is that the input of the function \(f\) is of dimension \(n\) of real numbers and the output is a real number. In programming terms, the function will look like this: ``
